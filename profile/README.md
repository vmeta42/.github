# ✨ Welcome to Meta42!

With the evolution of cloud computing and cloud-native technologies, more and more services, larger cluster sizes, and more complex applications make data centers bigger and bigger. TPOS, PUE and server density pose great challenges to the management level of data centers.

**Meta42**  :Based on the comprehensive perception, intelligent operation and digital twin of 42U standard cabinet of data center, we will further build a new generation of digital cabinet of data center with independent computing power chip and open source system. The long-term vision of the Meta 42 project is experimentation and exploration of the industrial metaverse, focusing on the creation of metaverse unique digital assets for global ET+IT hybrid equipment, as well as digital asset operation and trading.
